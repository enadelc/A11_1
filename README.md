Used Car Price Analysis
Summary of Findings
In this project, we aimed to identify the key drivers affecting used car prices. We analyzed a dataset containing various features such as vehicle age, mileage, make, model, and condition. Our analysis revealed that factors like vehicle age and mileage are significant predictors of price. We built and compared multiple regression models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, optimizing hyperparameters and validating model performance through cross-validation. The final model provides valuable insights for pricing strategies and inventory management.

Key Insights
Significant Features: Vehicle age and mileage are crucial drivers of used car prices.
Model Performance: The selected model demonstrates strong predictive accuracy and reliable performance metrics.
Recommendations: Adjust pricing based on vehicle age and mileage; consider optimizing inventory based on these insights.
